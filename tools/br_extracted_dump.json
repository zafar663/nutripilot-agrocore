        "INTRODUCTION",
        "Quail rearing for meat and egg production in Brazil has attracted",
        "attention due to the increasing number of production flocks and egg production",
        "per bird. These achievements are supported by research on housing, nutrition,",
        "genetics, health, and the application of modern technologies in commercial",
        "farms. In recent years, advancements in breeding Japanese quails led to",
        "heavier and more productive birds with larger eggs. These fast changes have",
        "not allowed for the standardization of commercial strains, contributing to",
        "variations in performance results.",
        "The anatomy, physiology, and behavior of Japanese quails differ from",
        "those of commercial laying hens; therefore, they require specific nutritional",
        "needs, justifying research to determine the requirements for optimal",
        "performance.",
        "For a comprehensive understanding of the nutritional requirements of",
        "quails, it is essential to consider various factors that can affect their nutritional",
        "needs. These include breed, strain, sex, feed intake, dietary energy level,",
        "suitability for meat or egg production, nutrient availability, temperature, air",
        "humidity, and the health status of the flock. Moreover, the nutritional program is",
        "crucial to ensure the health and well-being of the birds, as well as to maximize",
        "meat and egg production.",
        "The nutritional requirement tables for Japanese and European quails",
        "presented here were obtained by compiling the results of studies carried out at",
        "the Federal University of Northern Tocantins, the Federal University of Paraiba,",
        "the Federal University of the Semi-Arid Region, and the Federal University of",
        "Viçosa, in particular, as well as by other research institutions.",
        "Feed intake of birds can be estimated through the correlation between the",
        "metabolizable energy (ME) requirement and dietary energy values. It is",
        "important to note, that when birds are fed ad libitum, feed intake, and, more",
        "specifically, feed conversion ratio depend largely on the dietary energy content.",
        "The tables include examples of nutritional requirements of Japanese and",
        "European quails, for diets containing dietary energy values commonly adopted",
        "in Brazil. For other dietary energy values, corresponding adjustments in feed",
        "intake and other dietary nutrients should be made.",
        "- Brazilian Tables for Poultry and Swine",
        "350",
        "In order to allow dynamic calculation of the quails' nutritional",
        "requirements, nutritionists need to apply models that calculate daily nutrient",
        "requirements as a function of birds’ performance. For this purpose, equations",
        "for the daily nutritional requirements for the main nutrients were developed for",
        "Japanese quails during the grower, developer, and laying phases considering",
        "parameters that can be easily measured, such as body weight, weight gain, and",
        "egg mass. Additionally, recommendations for the nutritional requirements of",
        "European quails were included, although there is a lack of information about",
        "optimal levels for European quails.",
        "Amino acid requirements of quails were determined using diets based",
        "mainly on corn and soybean meal. When other feedstuffs are used, corrections",
        "should be applied to take into account nutrient digestibility in these feedstuffs."

        "INTRODUCTION",
        "The high prolificacy of swine breeders has allowed for an increase",
        "in the number of animals sold, thereby enhancing the profitability of the",
        "production system. Nonetheless, higher physiological and metabolic",
        "demands have been observed in hyper-prolific sows, influencing their",
        "nutritional requirements, especially in terms of energy and amino acids.",
        "The nutritional requirement tables present in this chapter were",
        "determined from research carried out with female swine breeders reared",
        "under national conditions, enriched by data from international literature",
        "regarding physiological and metabolic conditions.",
        "The advancement in nutritional concepts concerning the amino",
        "acid requirements of hyper-prolific swine breeders has led to the",
        "understanding that some amino acids are essential for the production of",
        "metabolites important for specific physiological functions, in addition to",
        "being necessary for maintenance and tissue synthesis, as well as having",
        "regulatory roles within the animal's body.",
        "The metabolic demands on current swine breeders frequently",
        "result in body weight losses during lactation and post-weaning,",
        "necessitating recuperation in the subsequent gestation. This highlights",
        "the importance of taking into account adjustments in nutritional",
        "requirements to ensure adequate reproductive performance in the future.",
        "Swine breeders exhibit differences in nutritional requirements",
        "based on parity order, attributable to different physiological components,",
        "including body growth, the number of piglets born, and weight loss during",
        "lactation, among others. As a result, as gilts and sows advance in the",
        "number of parities, the deposition of maternal protein decreases, and the",
        "protein and amino acid requirements are focused on replenishing the",
        "reserves that were mobilized during the previous lactation.",
        "In this chapter, metabolizable energy, crude and digestible protein,",
        "total and digestible essential amino acids, minerals, total calcium,",
        "available and digestible phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and chloride",
        "requirements are presented. The recommendations for trace minerals",

        "436",
        "and vitamins are assumed to be adequately met, provided the levels",
        "supplied are equivalent to those described in Chapter 7.",
        "The macronutrient requirements of swine breeders were",
        "established as the amount of nutrients per day per animal for optimal",
        "performance. Equations to determine the daily metabolizable energy (ME)",
        "and standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine requirements for gestating",
        "and lactating sows are presented. These equations take into account",
        "factors during the gestation phase such as body weight, weight gain,",
        "number of piglets, reproductive gain, mammary gland development,",
        "maternal growth, and recovery from weight loss from the previous",
        "lactation. For the lactation phase, factors considered include litter size,",

        "INTRODUCTION",
        "The vitamin and trace mineral requirements of poultry and swine are",
        "difficult to estimate because there are a large number of variables that can",
        "influence experimental results, including feed intake, genetics, physiological",
        "state, stress, and health challenges.",
        "In this chapter, supplementation of vitamin and trace mineral levels in",
        "poultry and swine diets is suggested, not nutritional requirements. Some",
        "articles used here present optimal levels of supplementation based on the",
        "animal's health (immunity, antioxidant capacity, etc.), which indirectly affects",
        "performance. Vitamin and trace mineral supplementation levels in IU or mg/kg",
        "of feed were based on articles, breeding company manuals, and industry",
        "recommendations.",
        "Taking into account the improved efficiency for production (meat,",
        "piglets, eggs, etc.) of current genetics lines, it is highlighted that feed intake",
        "capacity may be limiting the production potential. This fact draws attention to",
        "the need to adjust the levels of vitamins and trace minerals so that poultry and",
        "swine express their maximum genetic potential. Furthermore, variations in",
        "ingredient concentration, bioavailability, and the degradation of vitamins and",
        "trace minerals resulting from storage or feed manufacturing conditions, among",
        "others, must be considered in each production system.",
        "With the advancement of knowledge about minerals from organic",
        "sources and the availability of new supplements for animals, nutritionists have",
        "the possibility of choosing to use inorganic or organic sources of trace",
        "minerals. An average equivalency factor, calculated from published papers,",
        "was used to calculate organic mineral supplementation in mg/kg of weight",
        "gain.",
        "The recommendation of vitamins and trace minerals (IU or mg/kg)",
        "supplementation to broiler chicken diets, in the different growing phases was",
        "made using a proportion ratio, considering the level of growing phase I (17 to",
        "27 days) = 1.0, with the proportion of the pre-starter phase being 1.3 and that",
        "of the finisher phase being 0.7. The recommended amount, in IU or mg/kg of",
        "- Brazilian Tables for Poultry and Swine",
        "468",
        "feed, for each phase was calculated with the aim of keeping the intake of",
        "vitamins and minerals per kg of weight gain constant.",
        "The amount of trace minerals for laying birds and broiler breeders was",
        "calculated as 1.1 and 1.2 times (ratio), respectively, to that recommended for",
        "replacement pullet birds in the breeding phase.",
        "A ratio was also established in the recommendations for vitamins and",
        "trace minerals, in IU or mg/kg of feed, for growing swine. Grower phase I (63",
        "to 91 days) was used as a reference = 1, while for the other phases, ratios",
        "ranging from 1.6 for the pre-starter phase and up to 0.6 for the finisher phase II",
        "were stipulated. The recommended proportion in each phase aims to maintain",
        "a constant intake of vitamins and minerals per kg of weight gain.",
        "For breeding swine, the trace mineral recommendation was calculated",
        "following the ratio of 1.3 to that used for growing swine phase I.",
